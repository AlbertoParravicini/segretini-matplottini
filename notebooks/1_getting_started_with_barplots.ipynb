In this notebook, we will see an introduction to [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org), but most importantly to some of the key concepts to keep in mind when creating a great visualization.

    "## Exploratory visualization vs message-delivery plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all visualizations are created with the same goal. As such, not all plots have the same needs.\n",
    "A major distinction happens between the following two categories: **exploratory visualization** and **message-delivery plotting**, a name I just made up and that will be clear in a second.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔎 Exploratory visualization\n",
    "The idea of exploratory visualization is that you have some data that you know very little about, and you want to learn something more about it. The main point is that **you don't know yet what you are looking for**. You might have a hint, but the unknowns are more than what's known.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common situation is *exploratory data analysis*: you have a dataset, and want to understand something about it, e.g. class distributions, with the goal of building a predicting model that can leverage this newly discovered information.\n",
    "Another common situation is where you run a very complex experiment that tracks many metrics over multiple benchmark datasets. You don't know in advance what to expect, and you can use an exploratory visualization to make order in the chaos.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory visualization lies in the world of fast prototyping. The main audience of an exploratory visualization is **yourself** (or a narrow pool of people who are knowledgeable about the topic). **The goal is to use visualizations to understand something new.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⭐️ Message-delivery plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "In message-delivery plotting, you want to convey a message to an external target audience, and you need to convince this audience that your message is true. \n",
    "For example, your algorithm is more accurate than all the existing implementations of that same algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "How to best deliver the message is up to you: a sentence, a table, or a visualization. In many cases, a well-made visualization is the most impactful approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this situation, you know exactly what you want to show, and your goal is to show it in the **clearest way possible**. It has to be polished, curated, and clutter-free. It takes a long time, trial and error, and patience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Message-delivery plotting is the focus of this notebook, and of `segretini-matplottini`. We don't focus on exploratory visualization. If you want to know more about exploratory visualization, there are plenty of valid options, such as Seaborn's [`FacetGrid`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/axis_grids.html) and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/).\n",

    "\n",
    "First, we called `plt.rcdefaults()`. That's a bit out of the blue, but it's a very important command to remember. Matplotlib keeps a global state of style-related settings (we'll see later how to modify them), and this command ensures that everything is brought back to its default value before creating a plot. Without `plt.rcdefaults()`, it is easy to override some settings when creating multiple plots in the same script. Calling `plt.rcdefaults()` ensures that we always start from a blank slate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we created a `Figure` with `plt.figure()`, and the figure contains a single `Axes` (that is, an `x-axis` and a `y-axis`). \n",
    "* We can pass additional arguments to `plt.subplots` to control the number of `Axes`, their layout, and the resolution of the plot. We'll see some of these options later.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Finally, we called `plt.show()` to display the plot. \n",
    "* The command can be omitted when working in a Jupyter notebook, as the plot will be displayed automatically. However, it is necessary when working in a Python script. \n",
    "* An even better practice, when writing a script, would be to call `fig.show()` instead of `plt.show()`, as it explicitly specifies which is the `Figure` to display.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, Matplotlib provides some shorthands to access the latest `Figure` and `Axes` available. \n",
    "  * To access the latest `Figure`, we can use `plt.gcf()`, and to access the latest `Axes`, we can use `plt.gca()`.\n",
    "  * One can call `plt.show()` instead of `fig.show()`. That's equivalent to calling `plt.gcf().show()`.\n",
    "  * Similarly, one can call `plt.save()` instead of `fig.save()`, or `plt.plot()` instead of `ax.plot()`.\n",
    "  * My advice is to always use the `Figure` and `Axes` objects explicitly, as it reduces the chance of errors when working with multiple `Figures` and `Axes`."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Just one message\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have ten datasets, it might be tempting to show the performance of the models across all datasets. The result will be very confusing and hard to read. Instead, showing the average performance across all datasets will deliver the message more intuitively. Readers will spot the best model at a glance, instead of puzzling over the graph for minutes.\n",

    "\n",
    "### More is better, but only if it helps your message. \n",
    "\n",
    "This second point is strictly connected to the previous one. Adding more information to your plot, such as an arrow that highlights the best-performing model, a label that mentions how a higher score is better, or a grid that helps compare distant bars, can make the delivery of your message more powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "But adding elements for the sake of it, such as error bars in experiments where variance is minimal and all differences are statistically significant, or results divided across a dozen different datasets will counterintuitively weaken your message by making the plot harder to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Truth be told, many amazing papers have plots just like the one we just drew, and that did not weaken the quality of their research at all. But there are also many cases where a better plot can make your achievements clearer, and tip the balance in your favor."

The value of `get_xlim` will be something around `[-0.5, 5.5]` since we have six bar groups. Using `data` coordinates is useful when adding elements relative to some existing plot item, e.g. labels on top of the bars.\n",

    "## Adjusting the plot size\n",
    "\n",
    "In most situations where you create a plot, **you are bound by space constraints**, whether we are talking about a research paper, a poster, or a slide deck. You need to make efficient use of this space, avoiding unnecessary whitespace, while ensuring that everything is readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusting the plot size and its elements to make efficient use of the space is a critical step. When creating a plot from scratch, **start with a reasonable figure size**, then adjust the size of the elements as needed. This is faster than creating a beautiful plot without caring about its size, and then realizing that you need to redo everything because you will never be able to shrink the figure to the space you are given without making it unreadable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📐 Figure size, DPI, and PPI\n",
    "\n",
    "When talking about plot sizes, the following concepts are relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **figure size**, expressed in inches, is how much space is given to axes and other elements. If you create a figure whose size is `2 x 2` inches, it will be `2 x 2` inches when you save it. The default value in Matplotlib is `6.4 x 4.8` inches.\n",
    "* The **DPI** (dots per inch) says how many pixels are in an inch. If you create a figure whose size is `2 x 2` inches, and the DPI is `100`, the figure will be `200 x 200` pixels when you save it. **The default DPI is 100**. To get a crisp-looking image, it is better to use a higher DPI, such as `300` or `600`.\n",
    "* Some elements, such as text and lines, have their size expressed in points. The **PPI** (points per inch) in Matplotlib is `72` ([source](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/advanced/transforms_tutorial.html#using-offset-transforms-to-create-a-shadow-effect)). If you increase the figure size, you will also have to increase the font and lines size, to keep the same relative size. If you change the DPI, you will just increase the resolution, but the relative size of elements is unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib default values (figure size `6.4 x 4.8` inches, DPI `100`, PPI `72`) are good to create plots that are readable on a screen. But if you plan to use your plot on a paper, a poster, or something that is not a screen, you will need to adjust the figure size and DPI\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn provides a `set_context` function ([link](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.set_context.html)) that has some rules to scale the elements for contexts such as `notebook`, `paper`, `poster`. These are better than the default Matplotlib settings, but might not be enough for more advanced needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For reference, LaTeX has also a PPI of 72, since it is a typographical standard. A two-column paper template has a column width of around 252 points, or about 3.5 inches when considering a PPI of 72. A one-column template has a size of 395 points or about 5.5 inches. The font size of a typical research paper is something between 8 and 12, with 10 being the most common. These are also reasonable sizes for textual elements in your plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "`segretini-matplottini` uses `3.5 inches` as the default figure size for most plots, with a font size of `8`. Even if you are not creating a plot for a research paper, that's a reasonable figure size that ensures good readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏗️ Blueprint for adjusting the plot size\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are creating a plot from scratch, this blueprint works well.\n",
    "1. Start with a figure width that is reasonable for your use case. For example, `3.5 inches` for a 2-column LaTeX paper.\n",
    "2. Start with the same width and height (e.g. `3.5 inches`), unless you have a prior that a different height will be better. For example, `1.96 inches` if you are creating a plot for a `16:9` slide deck.\n",
    "3. Set a font size of `8`.\n",
    "4. **Create your plot.**\n",
    "5. **Adjust the left and right margins** with `plt.subplots_adjust()`. Also, the `wspace` (horizontal space between subplots), if you have a grid of plots.\n",
    "6. **Optimize the vertical space.** Usually, that means reducing the vertical space as much as possible, to save on vertical space for other text or plots. Start by reducing the figure height, then adjust the top and bottom margins with `plt.subplots_adjust()`. Also, the `hspace` (vertical space between subplots), if you have a grid of plots.\n",
    "7. If necessary, you can reduce the font size of elements such as tick labels. If you are creating a plot for a research paper, usually a font size as small as `5` or `6` will still be readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Advanced tips for plotting in notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "From this point onward, all cells that contain plots are affected by `set_matplotlib_formats(\"retina\", bbox_inches=None)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The setting `retina` increases the resolution of the plots rendered within the notebook. The setting doubles the DPI when rendering the plot while preserving the original height and width of the visualized plot (technically, the height and width are halved before rendering it). \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, `bbox_inches=None` **displays plots in the notebook exactly as they would be saved to a file.** \n",
    "Without it, Matplotlib is going to adjust margins automatically before displaying the plot, using the `tight` layout. While the `tight` layout gives a prettier result in the notebook, it is inconsistent with what we would save to a file. It also does not allow fine-tuning the margins with the same degree of precision, since adjustments are overridden by the `tight` layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ⚠️ Changes to `set_matplotlib_formats` are not overridden by `plt.rcdefaults()`. If you need to restore the default settings, use `set_matplotlib_formats(\"png\", bbox_inches=\"tight\")`"

    "Last but not least, let's customize the legend of the plot. The current legend works great, and there's no reason to modify it.\n",
    "But for the sake of it, let's see how we can adjust its style and position.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do the following.\n",
    "1. Make the legend horizontal.\n",
    "2. Place it outside the axes, below the plot.\n",
    "3. Customize the border of the legend.\n",
    "4. Reduce the width of the legend handles, and the rectangles that correspond to each category.\n",

    "And that's it! This is how you can create an amazing barplot, and customize even its smallest details. 👏\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 Plots in `segretini-matplottini` have a custom legend that contains a shadow below the legend, with opacity `1` and no blurring. By default, Matplotlib uses a shadow with a slight blur and transparency. Achieving the same look as `segretini-matplottini` demands some low-level changes to how the legend is rendered and goes outside the scope of this notebook. However, adding such a legend is simple! Just use `segretini_matplottini.utils.add_legend_with_dark_shadow`, passing the legend handles and labels to it."
