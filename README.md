## üë®‚Äçüî¨ Development notes

If you want to hack `segretini-matplottini` itself, you will most likely want to clone it with SSH, install it inside a `conda` environment, in `editable` mode, and with `dev` dependencies. Also install the `pre-commit` hooks to obtain linting and quality checks when creating a commit.
    
```shell
git clone git@github.com:AlbertoParravicini/segretini-matplottini.git
cd segretini-matplottini
conda create -n segretini_matplottini python=3.9
conda activate segretini_matplottini
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pre-commit install
```

We use `black`, `mypy`, and `ruff` for formatting, type checking, linting, and sorting imports. Each commit must pass their checks. To run checks manually, run the following. Checks are also ran when creating a commit. You won't be able to commit if a check fails.

```shell
black . --config pyproject.toml 
mypy . --config mypy.ini
ruff . --fix --config ruff.toml
```

## üí° Tips and Tricks

An ever-growing collection of tips I've found or discovered along the way, together with some nice resources I like a lot.

### üìö Resources 

* [Subtleties of Color](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/elegantfigures/2013/08/05/subtleties-of-color-part-1-of-6/): a six-parts guide on how to pick nice colors and create great palettes, from the Earth Observatory NASA blog.
* [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel): a free web tool to create palettes of different types (shades, complementary, etc.). It also has accessibility tools to test for color blindness safety.

### üé® Colors

Picking the right colors is hard! I found the following tips to be very helpful.

* **Not everyone sees colors in the same way**: most reviewers will look at your papers after printing them in black & white. Always check for that! You can do it with `matplotlib` (check out `hex_color_to_grayscale` in `src/plot_utils.py`) or doing a print preview after saving your plot as PDF.
If colors are too similar, try adjusting the **L** (lightness) in the **HSL** representation, or the **B** (brightness) in the **HSB** representation. 
Also, a lot of people are color blind, and there are many types of color blindness! It's always better to double check.

* **Hidden color biases**: people tend to associate implicit meanings to colors. To simplify the matter a lot, green is usually associated to positive things, while red is bad. 
If your plot is not explicitely comparing classes (for example, you want to show the speed of your algorithm on different datasets), just go for a neutral/positive palette, using colors such as gree, blue, and light pink.

* **Add redundant information**: if you are plotting many different classes, and use one color per class, it can be difficult to distinguish among them. Instead, add some kind of redundant information.
In scatterplots and lineplots you can use different markers (circles, diamonds, etc.), while in barplots you can use different hatches (//// or \\\\) or add labels to each class.
